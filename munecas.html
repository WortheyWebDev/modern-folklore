							<h2>Isla de las Muñecas</h2>

							<p>Isla de las Muñecas, or “The Island of the Dolls,” is a small
								island south of Mexico City with a dark history.</p>

							<p>Legend has it that a local man who found the body of a little
								girl in the water began to collect and decorate the island with
								dolls to ease her spirit’s suffering.

							<p>As time went on, this collection grew until the island’s
								structures and foliage were adorned with dozens of dolls.</p>

							<p>To those close to him, the caretaker seemed changed. He believed
								the dolls were possessed. Visitors to the island claimed to see many
								of the dolls move or turn their heads to watch them as the visitors
								passed by.</p>

							<p>The island earned a reputation as a cursed place where the spirits
								of angry children gathered and seethed into the land.</p>

							<p>After 50 years of collecting, the caretaker’s body was found in
								the same waters where he found the little girl.</p>
