							<h2>"Look Up"</h2>

							<p>A university student in the Philippines entered a campus
								restroom late one night.</p>

							<p>The restroom was empty, given the hour, and nothing about it
								seemed strange or out of place. But when she settled into a stall,
								unease began to take hold.

							<p>She was suddenly stricken with the feeling that she was being watched.</p>

							<p>After a few moments, she began to hear faint whispering. She
								listened closely but didn’t recognize the words. Fear finally got the
								better of her, and she ran from the room as quickly as possible.</p>

							<p>She asked a professor the next day if he recognized those words.</p>

							<p>“It’s Latin,” he told her.</p>

							<p>“It means ‘look up.’”</p>
