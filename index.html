							<h2>Legend Has It</h2>

							<p>Folklore has played a vital role in human history. Deities roamed the skies
								and shook the earth, embodying the perceived temperament of natural phenomena
								when the world around us behaved strangely. Dark things moved between the trees
								and stalked the water’s edge, ready to claim anyone foolish enough to ignore the
								warnings.</p>

							<p>We created a world that exists at the periphery of our own. There are stories
								and legends as deep and old as the people and places around them. These tales
								protected us from dangers and made sense of the things we could not.</p>

							<p>But folklore has evolved with advancements in society and technology to become
								urban legends. These modern tales still have a cautionary element but focus on
								telling hair-raising stories that spread over time and cement themselves in popular
								culture. Chain letters, Bloody Mary, alligators in the sewers; we’ve all heard one
								at some point.</p>

							<p>Modern Folklore is a collection of these stories. The purpose of this collection
								is not to verify the truth of the stories within or to provide an academic analysis
								of their underlying themes. They are provided simply for entertainment because
								that’s all they are.</p>
