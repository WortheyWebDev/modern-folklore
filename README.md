# Modern Folklore

## Description
Modern Folklore is the first front-end project I completed as part of my degree program to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project reflects my love for horror, folklore, and urban legends, bringing these interests to life in a web format.

The website is designed to capture the dark academia aesthetic, evoking the feeling of reading from an enchanted leather-bound tome. The goal is to immerse users in an atmosphere where the mysterious and the eerie are brought to the forefront.

The site also contains a hidden secret!

## Features
- **Dark Academia Design:** A visually captivating aesthetic that immerses users in a scholarly yet mystical environment.  
- **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript features for user interactions.  
- **Content-Rich Pages:** Information on various folklore and urban legends presented in brief but engaging stories.   
- **Accessible Navigation:** Easy-to-use menu and links for smooth browsing.  
- **Application Programming Interface:** Utilizes a geolocation API as part of the project's requirements.
- **Transition Animations:** Content animations to give a ghostly effect.
